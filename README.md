### API's
This application provides a RESTful API with various endpoints for interacting with the user data and the resources data (activities, restaurants, stays). It supports different HTTP methods including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, each with specific routes and responses.

These API endpoints allow for user authentication, data retrieval, data modification, and other features like favoriting a resource. For detailed information on the available endpoints, request/response formats, required parameters, and examples, please refer to the [API Documentation](docs/API.md).

### Database Schemas
This application uses a relational database with multiple tables including `user`, `activity`, `restaurant`, `stay`, and `favorites`. For a detailed database schema, see [Database Schema](docs/database_schema.md).

## VIII. Roadmap
While our application currently provides robust functionality for users to explore activities, restaurants, and stays in Puerto Rico, our vision extends beyond these freature. Here's a glimpse of what's next for Aventuras PR:

1. Expanded User Profiles: We aim to provide more personalization to our users by expandind user profile to include preferences, reviews & ratings.

2. Social Integration: Plans are underway to integrate with social media platforms. Users will be able to share their favorite places or experiences on their social media directly from our application.

3. Search Functionality: We are working on enhancing our search funcitonality to allow users to seach places.

Please note that the above features are under consideration and the timeline for their implementation may vary.
